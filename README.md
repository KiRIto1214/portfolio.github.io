### Projects
TEXT-SUMMARIZER
- Spearheaded an end‑to‑end text summarization project using
  Hugging Face’s Pegasus model API. and Applied advanced fine‑tuning
  techniques on a Samsung dataset
- Engineered and implemented a comprehensive data pipeline,
  encompassing data ingestion, transformation, validation, model
  training, and evaluation.
- Developed a resilient end‑to‑end solution by incorporating exception
  handling and logging mechanisms, ensuring project reliability and
  effective troubleshooting.
- Orchestrated the development of a user‑friendly UI with FastAPI,
  seamlessly integrating it with a robust data pipeline for optimal
  model interaction. and achieved commendable ROUGE scores,
  demonstrating proficiency in model development.
  
NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER

- Developed a Neural Style Transfer application using Streamlit,
  allowing users to transform their images using the styles of famous
  artworks. The implementation is based on a pre‑trained VGG‑19
  model
- Integrated a customizable interface that allows users to adjust key
  parameters such as alpha (content weight) and beta (style weight),
  providing them with greater control over the style transfer process.
- This feature not only enhanced the user experience but also provided
  insights into the impact of different parameters on the Neural Style
  Transfer algorithm

STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

- Led a data‑driven project, using EDA to inform modeling and
  designed a robust data processing pipeline for machine learning.
- Utilized regression models like SVM, Linear, and Random Forest
  Regressor to develop predictive models for math scores, Performed
  hyperparameter optimization, and achieved an r2 score of 0.8660.
- Ensured project resilience by implementing a robust
  exception‑handling system. Integrated logging and
  exception‑handling mechanisms for effective monitoring and
  troubleshooting, ensuring reliability in challenging scenarios.
- Developed a user‑friendly Flask interface for a clear, interactive
  presentation of model results.
  
AIR-CANVAS

- Developed a real‑time finger‑painting application using Python,
  OpenCV, and Mediapipe for hand tracking.
- Integrated the Mediapipe library for hand detection and tracking,
  enhancing the application’s interactivity and responsiveness.,
- Implemented color‑changing and canvas‑clearing functionalities
  based on finger gestures, demonstrating problem‑solving skills and
  attention to user experience
